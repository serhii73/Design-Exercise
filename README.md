# Security Company Analytics Use Case

Exercise Requirements:

    Design the Enterprise Bus Matrix (Tooling: excel sheets of similar table building tool)
    Design the Logical Data Model. Use entities and attributes mentioned in the exercise. If an entity contains less than 3 attributes please invent a couple of reasonable attributes (like Customer Name, Customer Yearly Income etc.) so that each entity would have at least 3 attributes. (Tooling: draw.io or your favorite modeling tool)


Background:

    You are working for a home security company SuperShield#1 that is selling the alarm systems to the end customers nation-wide across USA; providing services around installation and maintenance as well as taking proper actions during the actual alarm incidents. 
    There are a couple of packages provided for subscription selection covering the different set of options(service lines), like:  Video Surveillance, Web & Mobile Control, Camera Integrated Motion Detector, Cellular Communication, Fire & Carbon Protection, Environmental & Life Safety, Intrusion Protection and 24/7 Monitoring
    Each package requires the pre-defined set of equipment to serve it. Besides that, it is possible to build a custom package with custom equipment, including the different types of cameras, motion detectors, sensors, etc.  
    The packages include one-time payments for the equipment installation as well as monthly service fees according to the package subscription cost and is charged by monthly recurrence bases
    Ones equipment is installed, each piece of equipment once on a while (a couple of minutes) reports its health metrics 
    Depending on the type of equipment the maintenance/inspection jobs are scheduled upfront on the recurrence bases. The usual cadence is ones per quoter, half of year or year.  
    Inspections are being done by the technicians (employees of the SuperShield#1 company) and one job could require involvement of a couple of technicians.  
    Technicians are distributed between different teams and belong to a strict hierarchical structure of a variable depth.  Each technician has exactly one manager though

When an incident happenes (an alarm system detects suspicious circumstances) an automatic call to the SuperShield#1 call center takes place. An employee of the company takes the calls and follows the workflow: 

    Try to calls an owner of a property.
    If he/she takes the call it has an option to cancel an alarm or dispatch/forward call to emergency services
    If the owner doesn’t respond, the call is being dispatched/forwarded to the next responsible person queue (defined by an owner) which also can cancel the alarm or forward it to the emergency services
    If no human responds to a representative of the call center the call is dispatched/forwarded to the emergency services 


Analytics Requirements:

    Need to understand incidents statistics (# of Alarms, # of Dispatches, # of Phone call attempts, # of No Answers, # of Days after Installation) by the location up to the street address level, by customer, by date, by customer demographics, by time of the day.
    It is important to understand the compliance to the promised SLAs for the incident call processing: the time lags between first alarm happening and calling to the owner/second responsible/emergency services
    HR department needs to plan the human resource involvement for the scheduled maintenance/inspection jobs. The details about scheduled jobs are required by weekly bases, by types of maintenance jobs and by the required skills of the technicians.
    HR department also requires statistics for each technician how many jobs of which types he/she participated in during certain period of time as well as how many jobs were performed by his/her subordinates
    It is important to analyze billing statistics. Invoices are generated once a month and include detailed information for each service line according to the customer’s package subscription. The invoices could include chargers for the maintenance jobs offered.  
    Equipment suppliers are interested in reliability of certain equipment brands. So the statistics about health metrics sent as well as their issues and replacement jobs is required to be gathered and analyzed

It is important to analyze customers. Using available demographics data try to answer questions:

    Which customers bring the most money?
    Which ones tend to cancel the subscription in first/second/third moths/half a year?
    Having the nation people demographics statistics by location identify the regions with the biggest potentials for sales (to provide marketing campaigns)
    Measure the sales team effectiveness by comparing the sales forecast by location by customer segment by sales manager by month.
